	  This option enables Hyper_DMABUF driver.

	  This driver works as abstraction layer that export and import
	  DMA_BUF from/to another virtual OS running on the same HW platform
	  powered by a hypervisor

	  Expose run-time information about currently imported and exported buffers
	  registered in EXPORT and IMPORT list in Hyper_DMABUF driver.

        help
          With this config enabled, hyper_dmabuf driver on the importer side
          generates events and queue those up in the event list whenever a new
          shared DMA-BUF is available. Events in the list can be retrieved by
          read operation.

        help
          If enabled, driver reads a node in xenstore every 10 seconds
          to check whether there is any tx comm ch configured by another
          domain then initialize matched rx comm ch automatically for any
          existing tx comm chs.
